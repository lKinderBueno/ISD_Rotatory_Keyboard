# Rotatory Keyboard for Smart TV
The Rotatory Keyboard is an Android application developed using Kotlin Compose language specifically designed for Smart TVs. This unique keyboard provides a convenient and intuitive input method for users by combining multiple layout options such as QWERTY, ABC, CQWERTY, and Cirrin. The application aims to enhance the typing experience on Smart TVs, making it easier and more efficient for users to input text.

## Features
Rotatory Input: The Rotatory Keyboard utilizes a rotary input mechanism, allowing users to navigate through the available characters by rotating the TV remote control. This intuitive interaction method mimics the experience of using a physical rotary dial, making text input more enjoyable and efficient.

## Multiple Layout Options: The keyboard offers four layout options, including:

1. QWERTY: The standard QWERTY layout provides familiarity and ease of use for users accustomed to traditional keyboard configurations.
2. ABC: The ABC layout arranges the characters in alphabetical order, which can be useful for users who prefer a simplified input method.
3. CQWERTY: The CQWERTY layout is a variation of QWERTY where the characters are arranged in a circular pattern, optimizing the keyboard's design for rotary input.
4. Cirrin: The Cirrin layout is a unique circular layout specifically designed for the Rotatory Keyboard, providing an alternative to QWERTY and offering an optimized experience for rotary input.
